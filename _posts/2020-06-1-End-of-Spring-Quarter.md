Our project has drastically changed since its inception. Assumptions made about data flow and handling were revised, and the Trust Engine took on many revisions. Utlimately, we now have a product that can build a trust score based on user activity and authorize access dependent on a passing score. There is more to do, and we will speak on that at the end of the blog, but in it's current state we can now show a working product.
