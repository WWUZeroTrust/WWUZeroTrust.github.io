title: Zero Trust Network

	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	
		<p>The idea of trust in the technical landscape is rapidly changing with cloud infrastructure and increased 
			reliance on interdependent applications. Causing system designers to re-evaluate a means to approach 
			security. Often in the past networks were secured with the idea of a “walled garden” where you have a 
			secure perimeter around your technical assets with different levels and segmentation between certain zones.
			This exposed the All-or-Nothing trust system embedded in these networks, once users were past the perimeter, 
			they were fully trusted. Today, organizations are moving towards having their business operations hosted in
			the cloud, often combining multiple providers and products. The idea of creating a wall around your internal 
			systems in this new landscape is impossible. Zero Trust Networks are a response to both the previous approaches 
			to security as well as this changing landscape. By employing constant monitoring, scoring and constraining users' 
			actions Zero Trust Networks disregards any implicit trustworthiness of individuals instead focusing on predefined 
			metrics of trust. </p>

		<p> Our project was built on some of the fundemental concepts of Zero Trust. The information available online is
			sparse with little actual details on what tools to use nor available detailed roadmaps for creating a Zero Trust Network. We decided
			to build a small Zero Trust environment that would mimic the authentication and authorization measures that could
			be employed in a small enterprise environment. Most the tools used are open source and a few components our our network
			required building own programs.
