	<p><center> Authorization to sensitive resources require confirmation that the user is who they say they are and that their 
		activities on the company computer are considered normal behavior. Authentication begins with the user entering their 
		credentials to log into the the company website. But what if the users credentials were stolen? This is where the Trust
		Engine steps in by regularly ingesting data from the company issued device and processing that information into
		a trust score that can authorize or deny users for access to a secured application.

	<p><center> The client machine is preinstalled with <a href="https://github.com/osquery/osquery">osquery</a>, a tool that turns a computers information into a relational 
		database. A few additional configurations are need as well to enable the client to transmit data to the Kolide Fleet server. The 
		Kolide Fleet server is a tool used for managing a fleet of clients installed with osquery. Fleet can monitor if clients are
		active, its verison of osquery, and enable query packs to run on clients. These query packs consist of one or more queries
		that use pre-built osquery tables to output information about the computer such as active users or running processes. Fleet
		retrieves the data from the queries run on the clients and then stores the data using Redis and MySQL. We chose these tools because
		of osquery's ability quickly produce computer information from a simple query and deliver that information in JSON format.
